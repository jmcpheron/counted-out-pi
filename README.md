![Pi Bracelet](images/cover.jpg)

Express your love for mathematics with this flexible 3D printed bracelet! Designed specifically for the "Count It Out" movie screening event at Cal State Fullerton, this TPU bracelet combines style with mathematical significance.

## Quick Start

1. Download the STL file from the `models` directory
2. Print with TPU filament (95A flexibility recommended)
3. Wear your mathematical pride on your wrist!

## Repository Contents

- `src/` - OpenSCAD source file (for customization)
- `models/` - Ready-to-print 3D model files (STL, 3MF)
- `images/` - Photos and renders of the bracelet
- `docs/` - Detailed documentation and printing guidelines

For complete documentation, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)

## Printing Tips

TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) is a flexible filament that creates comfortable, wearable prints:

- Print slowly (20-30mm/s recommended)
- Use direct drive extruder if possible
- Minimal retraction settings
- No cooling fan or minimal cooling
- Bed temperature: 40-60Â°C
- Nozzle temperature: 220-235Â°C

## About the Event

This bracelet was created for the "Count It Out" movie screening at Cal State Fullerton's Mathematics Department. Join us to celebrate the beauty and wonder of mathematical concepts through film!
