Express your love for mathematics with this flexible 3D printed bracelet! Designed specifically for the "Counted Out" film screening event in Fullerton on Pi Day, this TPU bracelet combines style with mathematical significance.

## Quick Start

1. Download the STL file from the `models` directory
2. Print with TPU filament (95A flexibility recommended)
3. Wear your mathematical pride on your wrist!

## Repository Contents

- `src/` - OpenSCAD source file (for customization)
- `models/` - Ready-to-print 3D model files (STL, 3MF)
- `images/` - Photos and renders of the bracelet
- `docs/` - Detailed documentation and printing guidelines

For complete documentation, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)

## Printing Tips

TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) is a flexible filament that creates comfortable, wearable prints:

- Print slowly (20-30mm/s recommended)
- Use direct drive extruder if possible
- Minimal retraction settings
- No cooling fan or minimal cooling
- Bed temperature: 40-60Â°C
- Nozzle temperature: 220-235Â°C

## About the Event

This bracelet was created for the "Counted Out" film screening in Fullerton on Pi Day, March 14. The event is part of the global Pi Day celebrations.

### Event Details:
- **Date:** March 14 (Pi Day)
- **Format:** Film screening followed by a discussion panel

This screening is one of 314 showings of "Counted Out" happening globally throughout March in celebration of Pi Day. The award-winning documentary explores the role of mathematics education in addressing societal inequities through personal stories, expert interviews, and examples of mathematical transformations.

The film honors Bob Moses, the civil rights icon who developed The Algebra Project to address the lack of access to rigorous mathematics learning in urban and rural schools.
